## 🔍 Project Overview

Smart Plate is designed to assist users—especially health-conscious individuals and nutritionists—in identifying the food on a plate, analyzing its nutritional content, and determining whether the food is fresh or spoiled. This project combines **AI**, **IoT**, and **embedded systems** to deliver intelligent, sustainable food monitoring.

## 💡 Features

- 🍱 **Food Detection**: Uses AI (CNN models / PaddleOCR) to identify the food item placed on the plate.
- 📊 **Nutrient Classification**: Automatically classifies food based on nutrients (proteins, carbs, fats, vitamins).
- ⚠️ **Spoilage Detection**: Hardware sensors detect spoiled or unsafe food.
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**: View live results and nutritional insights from any device.
- ♻️ **Eco-friendly Design**: Prototype built using sustainable materials (like bamboo).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **AI Models**: CNN, PaddleOCR, Transfer Learning
- **IoT**: Arduino / ESP32, gas sensors, moisture sensors
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase (optional)
- **Cloud & Deployment**: (Add if applicable)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user places food on the Smart Plate.
2. A camera captures the food image.
3. AI model classifies the food and estimates its nutrient composition.
4. Sensors check for signs of spoilage.
5. All results are displayed on a web interface and stored for tracking.
